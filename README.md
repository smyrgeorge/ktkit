A comprehensive Kotlin multiplatform toolkit for building server applications with Ktor.

📖 [Documentation](https://smyrgeorge.github.io/ktkit/)

🏠 [Homepage](https://smyrgeorge.github.io/) (under construction)

## Usage

```kotlin
implementation("io.github.smyrgeorge:ktkit:x.y.z")
```

## Overview

KtKit is a Kotlin multiplatform toolkit designed to accelerate server-side application development with Ktor. It brings
together several libraries and patterns into a cohesive set of tools that handle the repetitive aspects of backend
development, letting you focus on your business logic.

> [!NOTE]
> **Early Stage Project**: KtKit is actively evolving. APIs may change between versions as we refine the abstractions
> based on real-world usage. Production use is possible but expect some breaking changes. Feedback and contributions are
> highly appreciated!

**What it does:**

- Provides type-safe abstractions for REST APIs, database operations, and message queuing
- Integrates observability from the ground up with structured logging and OpenTelemetry tracing
- Manages dependency injection, configuration, and request context propagation automatically
- Enables functional error handling patterns with Arrow's Either monad
- Supports multiple platforms (JVM, Linux, macOS) through Kotlin Multiplatform

**Why KtKit:**
Instead of wiring together Ktor, Koin, database clients, logging, and tracing yourself for every project, KtKit delivers
opinionated but flexible building blocks that work together seamlessly. Write less boilerplate, maintain consistency
across services, and ship faster.

## Features

### Key Technologies

- **Ktor**: HTTP server framework
- **Koin**: Dependency injection
- **log4k**: Structured logging with tracing
- **sqlx4k**: Multiplatform database access
- **Arrow**: Functional error handling with Either monad

## Example
